       " 'Problem': \"Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\",\n",
       " 'Solution': \"Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$, Alice will take $1$, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$, Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$, $3$, or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left.\\n\\nAfter some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is $n$ is a multiple of $5$, then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning.\\n\\nAfter some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$. So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$. Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin.\\n\\nSo we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$. There are $404$ numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \\\\dots, 2020$. For the second category, there are $405$ numbers. $2, 7, 12, 17, \\\\dots, 2022$. So the answer is $404 + 405 = \\\\boxed{809}$.\",\n",
